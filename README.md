# Minimal ROS 2 real-time cookbook recipes

Collection of ROS 2 minimal examples showing how to leverage different POSIX and ROS 2 features to
create real-time applications.

* [minimal_memory_lock](minimal_memory_lock/README.md): shows how to lock the
  process memory to avoid memory page faults
* [minimal_scheduling](minimal_scheduling/README.md): shows how to configure the thread(s)
scheduling policy and priority
* [minimal_data_sharing](minimal_data_sharing/README.md): shows how to use different data sharing approached to avoid
  blocking calls when sharing data between real-time and non real-time threads

TODO: Add other packages after review (currently in rolling-experimental branch): 
* minimal_cpu_affinity: shows how to set the process and threads CPU affinity
* minimal_realtime_loop: shows different approaches to created typical real-time time based loops
* minimal_deadline_qos: shows how to use the DDS deadline QoS policy
* minimal_lifecycle: shows how to use node lifecycle to separate configuration and runtime
 real-time phases
* minimal_memory_check: shows how use verify that functions used in the real-time path
does not allocate dynamic memory
* minimal_memory_allocator: shows how to use different memory strategies to avoid dynamic
 memory allocations during the runtime phase
* minimal_loaned_messages: shows how to use loaned messages APIs
 blocking calls when sharing data between real-time and non real-time threads 
* minimal_dds_tuning: shows how to use DDS specific configurations to tune real-time
 related settings (TODO: add XML profiles for more DDS implementations)


## Requirements

- ROS 2 rolling release
- Linux based operating system (RT_PREEMPT is not mandatory to run the examples)
- Privileges to set priority, scheduling and memory lock limits. This can be achieved by having
 root privileges or adding user privileges to `/etc/security/limits.conf`


## Build instructions

### Create workspace

```bash
$ mkdir -p ros2_realtime_examples_ws/src
$ cd ros2_realtime_examples_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/carlossvg/ros2-realtime-examples.git
# Optional: Build rmw_iceoryx for zero-copy examples
$ git clone https://github.com/ros2/rmw_iceoryx
```

### Install dependencies 

Use [rosdep](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/rosdep) to install the required dependencies:

```bash
$ cd ros2_realtime_examples_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src/ --ignore-src --rosdistro=rolling
```

### Build

Build examples

```bash
$ cd ros2_realtime_examples_ws
$ colcon build
```

**Note: Some examples might require to install additional RMW implementations**
